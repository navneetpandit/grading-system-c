# ðŸŽ“ Grading System in C (Extended with GPA Evaluation)

This repository contains my **C programming projects** for grading students.  
It started with a **basic grading system** and later expanded to include **GPA evaluation**.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Version 1: Basic Grading System (`marks.c`)
- Input marks (0â€“100)
- Output grades:
  - A (90â€“100)
  - B (80â€“89)
  - C (70â€“79)
  - D (60â€“69)
  - Fail (< 60)
- Input validation for marks

### Version 2: Grading + GPA Evaluation (`grading_gpa.c`)
- Includes everything from Version 1
- Adds GPA input (0.0â€“10.0) with evaluation:
  - Excellent (â‰¥ 9.5)
  - Awesome (â‰¥ 8.5)

  - Average (â‰¥ 6.5)
  - Needs Improvement (< 6.5)

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcome

Practiced if-else conditions with ranges

Validated multiple inputs (marks + GPA)

Extended a project instead of starting from scratch

Learned how to structure multiple versions in one repo

ðŸ”® Whatâ€™s Next

Allow grading of multiple students in one run (loops)

Save results into a file (file handling in C)

Add a menu system for better user experience

âš¡ This repo now contains my Version 1 & Version 2 grading projects in C. More updates coming soon ðŸš€
