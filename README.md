🎓 Grading System in C

A simple program written in C that calculates a student's grade based on their marks.
This project is part of my 1st Year B.Tech CSE journey, where I’m learning the fundamentals of programming.

🚀 Features

Takes marks (0–100) as input

Outputs grades:

A (90–100)

B (80–89)

C (70–79)

D (60–69)

Fail (< 60)

Includes input validation for marks outside 0–100

🛠️ How to Run
git clone https://github.com/navneetpandit/grading-system-c.git
cd grading-system-c
gcc marks.c -o grades
./grades

📌 Example Run
Enter the marks (0–100): 85
Grade: B

🎯 Learning Outcome

This project helped me practice:

Conditional statements (if-else if-else)

Handling ranges and boundary conditions

Validating user input

🔮 What’s Next

Add GPA calculation

Allow grading of multiple students in one run (using loops)

Convert into a menu-driven program

⚡ This is my second project in C after a simple calculator — small steps, consistent learning 🚀
